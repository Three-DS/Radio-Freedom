gpu
=======

example of how to use the GPU with libctru

before trying to compile, make sure to download aemstro
( https://github.com/smealum/aemstro reflog: 55bf5056d199e0e9ec3d136dc830ac45a49da074 )
and update Makefile's AEMSTROPATH definition with the proper path

You'll also need to install Python 3 and have that in your path.

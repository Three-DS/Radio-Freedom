<p>Other background support info<br>
the marxist/leninist/Nintendo insist on request update every wifi enabled bootup, I use emuNand with MT-Card when getting under the sheets. In many ways torn about I MUST decline that call from home! Still yearn for their support in my vision of "DS/3DS Dream Cartrage, those cry baby telecom network will beg for" &amp; Corporate,TM branding independent from "Communist dictator, VideoGame" life here is not, are to expect out side of "videogame's" terms, an electronic albatross &amp;or potential brick for sale, or hope to close more sold on the floor?
<br><br>
If marxist/leninist/Nintendo 3DS as electrionic Device it features and those use in competitive free market democratic, society & ask remuneration for this open source platinum of "3DS swayed with FPC-Pascal influence" & that freedom writers is like what the (Jobs & them Apples) or (MSWindow & the PC) for a base of $60 --> 6000 tutions &amp; school AP's? --> executive $60,000 or Avg. per seat 270.00 desks! Givin the faculties of smart & mobile, a workplace features found with in such an enriched electronic Device! We are always looking for developers & talented others. How ever contrived these events may sound really did transpire getting in to development testbed, booting, blue brick? &gt;&gt; nope, good! workin .. workin &gt; nope!  &lt; flip files on carts &amp; comments the cold booting ... over and over & if you don't trust me with your money? Nor I did I ask for any endorsement from Smea concerning GNU's Radio-freedom C/C++, but made prior request of "we deal with our freepascal legion's", &amp offer form me to that same "Professor", his replies on the net answer "we are free for now & [pursue gainful employment](https://www.facebook.com/Three-DS-973285209425506/?notif_t=fbpage_fan_invite)"! 
<br><br>  The absolute of range of land the $$,BUT,$$$.$$ &amp; their is ways to "the booty" several times over, when I bake cake going for the Icing, on socket gods I swear the mmm,mmm,muff$ all the of it's there, any of think to yourselves that have ever got into testbed <br>  
a. We risked 3D sexlife & 3D undocumented limb.<br>
b. Unbale to proform work duties @ W3's Crotchdog, 3D adult films.<br>
c. Your marxist/leninist/Nintendo 3DS device put under the influence Pascal with ctru-pas R&D reach around! </p>
